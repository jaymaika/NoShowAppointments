# NoShowAppointment Data Analysis

## Dataset

The No show appointments dataset contains 110527 observations about patients who kept to their appointments and those who missed out on their appointments. The purpose of this collection is to determine the factors that are important to determine patients who are likely to keep to their appointments. The gender, age, health status, health scholarship status and the hospital neighbourhood of the patients are provided in the dataset.


## Summary of Findings

From our analysis, we have been able to identify some correlations between some of the independent features and our dependent feature (No-show). Features that have been identified to determine if a patient will likely show up to their appointments are the age of the patient, the underlying health of the patient, whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program and how many days between when the appointment was scheduled and the appointment date.

Age: From our analysis, we saw that most patients above the age of 37 and below the age of 18 tend to keep to their appointment date than other age brackets.
Health Status: Patients that suffer from diabeties and hypertension have been seen to keep to their appointments, however, I couldn't see a strong correlation here.
Scholarship: From our analysis, there seems to be a negative correlation between the scholarship patients and whether they show up to their appointment, however, it is not a strong correlation.
No.of.Days: The average number of days between scheduled date and appointment date for patients who are more likely to keep to their appointment is 8 days. This would mean that days longer than 8, say, two weeks and above has a negative impact on the patient's attendance.
For easy visual and understanding of the no-show feature, I have color coded bars that signify Patients showing up as GREEN and patients who missed their appointments as RED

There were no missing data in our dataset, however, I believe a limitation to this anaysis was the time period. The data set contained records from November 2015 to June 2016, which is a short period of time to gain insights on important features that determine if a patient will keep to appointments
